# ECE208-Final-Project
## Project Description

HIV, known as human immunodeficiency virus, can cause terrible disease whose final stage is AIDS. It most often spreads through unprotected sex. Therefore, it is meaningful to predict the spread speed of HIV infection within a group of people who may have intimate relationships. In this paper, we introduce a way to predict the spread speed of HIV infection. Also, we find a way to predict the real infection speed through the data of diagnosis data. Which might be meaningful to help control the spread speed of HIV

## Code Description

For problem1, simply run
`
$ python Problem1_new.py
`

For problem2, the training part is commented in the source code. You can just uncommented them to perform the training. To do the prediction, run
`
$ python Problem2_new.py
